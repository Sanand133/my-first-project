# Hotel Management System
This project is my first ever project and was developed in a group. 
The Hotel Room Management System is a desktop application designed to simplify how hostels manage their rooms. 
It helps administrators keep track of room availability, handle bookings, and manage guest check-outs efficiently.
The system aims to replace the manual, error-prone processes with a digital solution.

**SYSTEM DETAILS**
*Tools and Technologies*
The system is built using:
● Python: The main programming language.
● Tkinter: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
● CSV (Comma-Separated Values): Used for saving and loading room data.
● tkcalendar: A library for selecting dates easily.
*Key Features*
The system allows users to:
● View all hostel rooms and their details.
● Find available rooms, with options to filter by AC or bed type.
● Book rooms for guests, recording their names and stay dates.
● Check guests out of rooms, providing a summary of their stay.
● Save all room and booking data so it's available next time the application is opened.
